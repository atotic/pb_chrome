Chrome must be run with --no-sandbox flag.

We need to bypass the sandbox because page_capture.cc does not know how to allow printing process access to pdf_file

This line should do the job, but it does not. I suspect that child_id of print_web_view_helper process is different.
int child_id = render_view_host()->GetProcess()->GetID();
ChildProcessSecurityPolicy::GetInstance()->GrantCreateReadWriteFile(child_id, pdfPath);
